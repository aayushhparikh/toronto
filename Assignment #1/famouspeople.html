		<h2><b>Famous Torontonians</b></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Drake</li>
			<p>Before he was winning grammys and being the king of pop culture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)">Aubrey Graham</a> lived on Weston Road and in Forest Hill. Drake still reps the 6ix and is proud of his hometown</p>
			<li>Jim Carrey</li>
			<p>From being an A-list comedian to being a Leafs fan, Jim Carrey grew up in Scarborough and Northyork, he came up in the comedy scene in the mid 70s and later moved to <a href="https://www.lacity.org/">Los Angeles </a> when he was 21.</p>
			<li>Margaret Atwood</li>
			<p>Atwood, arguably Toronto's greatest contribution to the field of literature (and now television, with the success of Handmaid's Tale) grew up between the city, Ottawa and Quebec before settling in Toronto during high school. She's lived in the Annex since the mid-'80s.</p>
			<li>Mike Myers</li>
			<p><p>Mike Myers is known worldwide for his comedy, going from Wayne's World, Saturday Night Live to Austin Powers and everything else in between, born in Scarborough he was named as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada#Officer">Officer of the Order of Canada.</a></p></p>
			<li>Samanth Bee</li>
			<p>She may be famous for her clever take on American politics, but the former Daily Show correspondent was born and raised right here in Toronto. Bee, who was named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people, is also the first woman ever to host a late-night satire show.</p>
			<li>Kiefer Sutherland</li>
			<p>The veteran actor, best known for his starring turn in 24, moved to Toronto at age nine from California and attended a whopping nine elementary and high schools over the course of his youth. Bonus Canadian fact: He's the grandson of Tommy Douglas.</p>
			<li>Frank Gehry</li>
			<p>Considered one of the world's greatest architects, Gehry was born in Toronto in 1929. His grandfather's Queen West hardware store was reportedly a launching pad for his earliest interests in construction and architecture. He lives in California now, but is undoubtedly a local hero.</p>
			<li>Keanu Reeves</li>
			<p>Before he was Neo or Ted "Theodore" Logan, Keanu Reeves lived in Toronto. He attended four local high schools in five years, including De La Salle College and Etobicoke School for the Arts (which, at one point, expelled him).</p>
			<li>Shawn Mendes</li>
			<p>While he might call Pickering his hometown, the heartthrob du jour was actually born in Toronto and makes frequent visits to the city including his recent appearance at the MMVAs.</p>
			<li>The Weekend</li>
			<p>Drake isn't the only well-known successful artist from Toronto. The Weeknd, known for his hugely successful hits and fantastic hair, grew up in Scarborough. He is rumoured to have peddled his mixtape from the stockroom of a clothing shop he worked in at a young age, until he made it big on the world scale. </p>
